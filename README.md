# Deep-Learning-with-Keras-using-python-
Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.

There is not a lot of code required, but we are going to step over it slowly so that you will know how to create your own models in the future.

The steps you are going to cover in this tutorial are as follows:

Load Data.
Define Keras Model.
Compile Keras Model.
Fit Keras Model.
Evaluate Keras Model.
Tie It All Together.
Make Predictions
